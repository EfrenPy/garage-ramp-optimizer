# How to compile `rampa.exe` (Windows)

`ramp_optimizer.py` runs as-is with Python, but if you prefer a single
GUI `.exe` that can be opened with a double-click (no Python visible
to the user), follow these steps. **PyInstaller** bundles the
interpreter and every dependency inside the `.exe`, so there is no
`.bat` and nothing the antivirus typically blocks.

## 1. Requirements

- **Python 3.10 or newer** installed on Windows
  (https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).  Tick **"Add Python to
  PATH"** during the installation.
- Internet access the first time (so pip can fetch `numpy`, `scipy`,
  `matplotlib` and `pyinstaller`).

## 2. Build the executable

1. Open **`cmd`** (Command Prompt) or **PowerShell**.
2. Navigate to the project folder:

       cd C:\Users\Efren\Projects\garage

3. Run the build script.

   - **English UI (default):**

         python build_exe.py

   - **Spanish UI** (everything in the GUI, the console output, the
     plot titles and tables, etc. is in Spanish):

         python build_exe.py --spanish

     `--es` is a short alias.

   The first run will pip-install `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib` and
   `pyinstaller`. Expect it to take a couple of minutes.

4. When it finishes you will see a banner that reads
   **`OK. Executable created [English UI]:`** (or `[Spanish UI]`) and
   the file lands at:

       dist\rampa.exe

   The resulting binary weighs ~80–120 MB because it ships Python,
   numpy, scipy, matplotlib and Tk inside.

## 3. Use the executable

### GUI mode (recommended)

**Double-click** `dist\rampa.exe`.  The window has:

- Input fields for **rise** (cm) and **horizontal length** of the
  ramp (cm).
- Car parameters: ground clearance, wheelbase, front and rear
  overhangs.  They default to a Seat León FR 2025; tweak them for
  your car.
- Output-folder picker (defaults to the folder containing the
  `.exe`).
- A **"Calculate and generate blueprints"** button.
- A real progress bar (0–100 %) with a numeric percentage label.
- A live **elapsed-time** counter that ticks every second.  The full
  computation usually takes **between 1 and 3 minutes**.
- A scrolling text box that shows the live log of the calculation.
- An **"Open output folder"** button.

A pop-up confirms when the calculation is finished.

### Silent mode (command line)

From `cmd`, pass values directly. **No GUI is opened**, the
blueprints are produced straight to disk.  Useful for automation:

    dist\rampa.exe 136 540

with all the optional car parameters:

    dist\rampa.exe -d 136 -l 540 -c 14 -w 269 -f 87 -r 0

| flag | parameter |
|---|---|
| `-d` / `--desnivel` / `--rise` | rise (cm) |
| `-l` / `--longitud` / `--run` | horizontal length of the ramp (cm) |
| `-c` / `--altura-libre` / `--clearance` | ground clearance (cm) |
| `-w` / `--batalla` / `--wheelbase` | wheelbase / distance between axles (cm) |
| `-f` / `--voladizo-delantero` / `--front-overhang` | front overhang (cm) |
| `-r` / `--voladizo-trasero` / `--rear-overhang` | rear overhang (cm), default 0 |
| `--lang en` / `--lang es` | force English / Spanish output, regardless of how the binary was compiled |

## 4. Outputs

The program writes seven blueprint pairs (each as **PNG** and **PDF**)
plus several CSV tables in the chosen output folder (next to the
`.exe` by default).

### Blueprints

| File | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `ramp_blueprint.png/.pdf` | 3 piecewise slopes, referenced from the start of the ramp (origin (0,0) on the garage floor). |
| `ramp_blueprint_top.png/.pdf` | 3 slopes, referenced from the wall / top of the ramp (cotas `u` horizontal, `d` downward). |
| `ramp_blueprint_top_4slope.png/.pdf` | 4 slopes, referenced from the wall. |
| `ramp_blueprint_top_smooth.png/.pdf` | Smooth (PCHIP) curve, stations every 30 cm along the wall. |
| `ramp_blueprint_chord_4slope.png/.pdf` | 4 slopes, **straight cord T → B as the reference**. Each corner has its `s` (along the cord) and `p` (perpendicular to the cord). |
| `ramp_blueprint_chord_smooth.png/.pdf` | Smooth curve, same cord system, stations every 30 cm. |
| `ramp_profile.png/.pdf` | Side-by-side comparison of the 5 profile families (linear, two arcs + straight, 3 slopes, 4 slopes, smooth). |

The **PDF** copies are vector graphics: zoom in as much as you want
without pixelation.

### CSV tables

| File | Coordinates |
|---|---|
| `ramp_offsets.csv` | (x, y) of the "two arcs + straight" profile, 28 points. |
| `ramp_offsets_3slope.csv` | (x, y) of the 3-slope profile, 28 points. |
| `ramp_offsets_4slope.csv` | (x, y) of the 4-slope profile, 28 points. |
| `ramp_offsets_smooth.csv` | (x, y) of the smooth curve, 40 points. |
| `ramp_offsets_3slope_top.csv` | (u, d, drop-from-wall), wall reference, 3 slopes. |
| `ramp_offsets_4slope_top.csv` | (u, d, drop-from-wall), wall reference, 4 slopes. |
| `ramp_offsets_smooth_top.csv` | (u, d, drop-from-wall), wall reference, smooth curve. |
| `ramp_offsets_4slope_chord.csv` | (s, p), cord reference, 4 slopes. |
| `ramp_offsets_smooth_chord.csv` | (s, p), cord reference, smooth curve. |

## 5. Sign conventions

### Cord-reference system (`*_chord*`)

- **s** = distance along the straight cord T → B, measured from
  **T** (street, top) toward B (garage, bottom).
- **p** = perpendicular distance from the cord to the actual surface.
  - **p > 0** → the surface lies **ABOVE** the cord.
  - **p < 0** → the surface lies **BELOW** the cord (the usual case:
    the ramp dips slightly under a tight cord stretched between the
    two corners).

### Wall-reference system (`*_top*`)

- **u** = horizontal distance measured from the top edge of the ramp
  toward the garage (u = 0 at the street, u = run at the garage).
- **d** = depth below the top plane (d = 0 at street level,
  d = rise at the garage floor).
- **drop from the wall** = vertical distance from the chalk-line on
  the wall (136 cm above the street by default) down to the surface.
  This is the value the worker reads off a tape measure.

## 6. If the antivirus blocks `rampa.exe`

Some antiviruses flag PyInstaller-built executables as suspicious by
reputation (any uncommon `.exe` can trigger a warning).  Workarounds:

- Add the `dist\` folder to the antivirus' exclusion list.
- Or run the script directly with Python without compiling:

      python ramp_optimizer.py

  (no arguments → GUI; with arguments → silent mode).

## 7. Advanced configuration

If you want to tune the plots beyond the GUI flags, edit these
constants in `ramp_optimizer.py`:

- **Wall height above the street** (default 136 cm).  Look for
  `WALL_OFFSET = 136.0` inside `compute_and_save`.
- **Station spacing** for the smooth profile (default 30 cm).  Look
  for `station_step_cm=30.0` in the calls to
  `draw_smooth_blueprint_topref` and `draw_chord_blueprint`.

After editing, rebuild with `python build_exe.py` (add `--spanish` if
you want Spanish output).
